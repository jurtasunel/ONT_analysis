# ONT_analysis

All barcode directories must be on the same data directory specified on the ONT_analysis_pipeline.sh script.

ONT_analysis_pipeline.sh is the parent script to run. It produces a result directory for each of the barcodes and a final results directory with the quality_report.csv and coverage_barplot.png for all the samples.
